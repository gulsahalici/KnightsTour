# Warnsdorff’s algorithm for Knight’s tour problem

```bash
Problem: A knight is placed on the first block of an empty board and,
moving according to the rules of chess, must visit each square exactly
once.

```

## Warnsdorff’s Rule

```bash
1. We can start from any initial position of the knight on the board.
2. We always move to an adjacent, unvisited square with minimal degree
(minimum number of unvisited adjacent).

```

## Information
I programmed Knight's tour problem with C++ and Object Oriented Programming, using Warnsdorff's algorithm.
